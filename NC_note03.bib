abstract = {Abstract Although a theological exchange of ideas between Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Christians flourished at the end of the twentieth century, the ecumenical achievements of these discussions have been met with notable objections and critiques by theologians. This article focuses on one key notion that was highlighted for having been left unresolved in the ecumenical discussions, namely the concept of the difference of the natures of Christ ‘in contemplation only’ (ἐν ϑεωρίᾳ μόνῃ). The essay revises the traditional Chalcedonian perspective with regard to the interpretation of difference in contemplation, which considers it to be based on the assumption of a real distinction between the natures after Incarnation. The argument shows that this view was intended to form a response to the anti-Chalcedonian notionalist interpretation, according to which the natures are only conceptually differentiated. By reconstructing the philosophical background of some notable sixth-century Chalcedonian theologians, along with Cyril of Alexandria as the main theological source for the anti-Chalcedonians, the essay will suggest that they bear the influence of opposing philosophical perspectives on conceptualization. The argument will show how some of the theological differences between the Chalcedonians and Cyril follow closely opposing attitudes in ancient philosophy towards fictional entities and conceptual constructivism. The conclusion will advocate that future ecumenical dialogues should take into account the relevance of these epistemological differences.},

abstract = {Abstract Monophysitism is the belief that in the one person Jesus of Nazareth there is one nature (monos, “single”; physis, “nature”), as opposed principally to the Chalcedonian formula, the Definition of Faith of the Council of Chalcedon (451), which declares two natures (dyophysitism) coexisting in one person. The Chalcedonian decree, according to the Monophysites, is ontologically speculative and theologically dubious. Monophysitism's principal difficulty is locating the unity of two natures, and resolves any apparent conflict by emphasizing the one divine nature, from the beginning of Jesus' incarnation forward.}

abstract="The Christian Church and the development of Christianity were fundamental to the cultural and political evolution of the empire. For Constantine I the Church had been a valued political ally in his effort to stabilise the empire and to consolidate his own power. For that reason it had been essential that the church remained united: discord and disagreement was politically threatening for an emperor who privileged the Christian Church in terms of landed property and formal recognition in his political plans. But Constantine had to deal with a major split within the church, brought about by the appearance of Arianism, a heresy about the Trinity and the status of Christ. Arius (250--336) was a deacon of the church at Alexandria. Trained in Greek philosophy, he became an ascetic, and in his attempts to clarify the nature of the Trinity, produced a creed that was for many contemporaries heretical. He could not accept the notion that God could become man: he taught that Jesus was not eternal and co-equal with the father, but created by Him. Arius was excommunicated in 320 by the Bishop of Alexandria, and in 325 at the Council of Nicaea he was condemned and exiled.",

abstract="In this chapter I want to focus on the genesis and development of a conceptual demarcation running through western society from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages whereby a particular discourse of power is privileged over against others. The nexus of this discourse is the West-East dualism and the corresponding counter-factualism of an `us'/'them' polarity. I wish to show that one of the most enduring forms of western identity was the postulation of a centre, anchored in a historical myth of origins, and that this served to reinforce the formation of adversarial world-views. The origins of Eurocentrism, then, lay not in the idea of Europe itself as a cultural model, but in the structures of a discourse which served to reinforce the power of the centre. Thus, when the idea of Europe emerged as a cultural idea it became associated with structures of power and their identity projects. The cultural space for the formation of an autonomous discourse of Europe had not yet formed. Prior to the early modern period the idea of Europe was always articulated through other discourses, of which the most significant was Christendom. In other words, then, `European' identity, as an ethno-cultural and political project, preceded the formation of the idea of Europe as such. But of course we cannot call this a `European identity' since it was never focused on the idea of Europe itself. The idea of Europe when it did emerge was embedded in Christendom having become virtually coterminous with the notion of the Occident, which preceded the idea of Europe. It was this latter notion of the Occident or West that provided continuity between Hellenism, Christendom and the idea of Europe.",

Its aim is to place Chalcedon in a broader context, and bring out the importance of the acts of the early general councils from the fifth to the seventh century, documents that because of their bulk and relative inaccessibility have received only limited attention till recently. This volume is evidence that this situation is now rapidly changing, as historians of late antiquity as well as specialists in the history of the Christian Church discover the richness of this material for the exploration of common concerns and tensions across the provinces of the Later Roman Empire, language use, networks of influence and cultural exchange, and political manipulation at many different levels of society. The extent to which the acts were instruments of propaganda and should not be read as a pure verbatim record of proceedings is brought out in a number of the essays, which illustrate the fascinating literary problems raised by these texts.},

 abstract = {Leo is known as one of the first and most forceful bishops of Rome to claim supremacy based on succession from St. Peter. The most important studies focus on how he expressed this supremacy, especially in letters addressed to other church and imperial officials. Leo was also a conscientious pastor, however, who thought about Peter and his legacy in terms other than supremacy. For example, Leo preached repeatedly about Peter's denial of Christ and subsequent repentance, sometimes in contrast with the failed repentance of Judas. The power Peter derived from his penance, according to Leo, was not only key to his pastoral success but also fundamental to the authority he passed on in the Church. The author focuses on key texts related to the repentance of Peter and Judas and suggests how they may help improve our understanding of Leo's thoughts on penance and justice.},

abstract="Historians of ancient philosophy and theological writers often come up against the puzzling issue of understanding the meaning of the term hypostasis used by different ancient authors. One could hardly expect that the same issue would be of interest for historians of ancient mathematics. Indeed, altogether absent from the works of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius, and scarcely appearing in a nonmathematical context in the works of Heron and Nicomachus, the term hypostasis and its cognates appear 127 times in the six books of Diophantus' Arithmetica preserved in Greek. This chapter examines Diophantus' use of the term hypostasis and argues in favour of interpreting it as a term for numbers qua specific, individual entities. It is composed of three parts. The first part discusses the different statuses of numbers in a worked-out problem according to Diophantus' general method, and the relevant issue of the Diophantine conception of an arithmetical problem; the second part investigates all instances of the term within Diophantus' text; and the third part surveys briefly the testimonies of the Byzantine commentators of the Arithmetica, which provide further evidence supporting the interpretation proposed in this paper.",

abstract="Before beginning any attempt to understand something of the mystery of the hypostatic union and of the consciousness of Christ, it is necessary to insist most firmly upon the absolute transcendence of God in regard to the world. The Uncreated Life of the three divine Persons stands eternally immutable and untouched by the decision to create, by the existence of creatures, and even by the hypostatic union of the human nature of Christ with the Second Person of the Trinity. No creature could ever rise to God, touch Him, cling to Him so as to comprise His utter transcendence of every creature. The total being of every creature is entirely dependent on God, and this dependence includes even the union of the creature with God. Therefore, if there is some union of creature to God, it is God who with complete gratuity and preserving His complete transcendence unifies and is the bond of unity between the creature and Himself. There is nothing between the creature thus unified to God and God, no created claim, which would in some sense pull God down to union with the creature. If God should choose to enter into a fuller union with some creature, this will be accomplished by the divine knowledge, love, and decree of all three Persons acting in concert and wholly prior to the actual drawing of the creature into such a union. Indeed, this decree of the three Persons, with its infallibility in producing its created effects, is already the union itself (in the active sense). The created effect primarily produced by the decree, a created term or reality referring the creature to God in a new way, can be called union (in a passive sense); but this is only secondary and consequent union depending entirely for its being on the primary active union which is the uncreated divine decree.1",

abstract = {Hypostasis was measured in 93 cadavers using a tristimulus colorimeter in order to investigate its relationship with the time of death. The intensity (lightness) of the hypostasis in each case was measured over a period of 4 h and the rate of change in lightness derived. When examined against the time of death, it was found that there was a good correlation between the two. Namely, that the rate of change of lightness (and it can be inferred that this represents displaceability) decreases as the post-mortem period increases. The shift in hypostasis was particularly marked in the first 12 h and decreased thereafter. However, hypostasis could be useful for time of death estimation for up to 48 h. After this time, the degree of change was small or non-existent and by 72 h hypostasis had become fixed in the majority of cases, within our measuring period of 4 h.}

Abstract={Correct interpretation of autopsy findings related to neck structures can be challenging and has tremendous legal importance. We describe a case of a 30-year-old man who was found dead in a hotel courtyard, facedown. The window of his hotel room on the 5th floor was wide open. Police investigation revealed that he was a gambler with many debts, leading them to suspect foul play. The body was transported for a forensic autopsy in a supine position. External examination showed multiple lacerations and contusions of the face and limbs, without signs of external neck injuries. Layer-by-layer neck dissection was unremarkable. Upon opening the pharynx and esophagus, dark purple discoloration of the pharyngeal mucosa could be seen, with a clearly defined margin to the pale circumferential appearance of the rest of the mucosa. To exclude possible tissue bruising due to potential neck compression, histological examination of the mucosa was carried out. Where the mucosa was purple in appearance, there was blood inside the blood vessels, while the vessels of the macroscopically pale mucosa were empty. After forensic autopsy and a detailed police investigation, the manner of death was ruled suicide. In the neck, differential diagnosis between hypostasis and bruising can be especially difficult in rapid, congestive deaths. Forensic pathologists have to be aware of many possible autopsy artifacts in this topographical region, one of those being “banding” of the esophagus. Herein we propose a possible pathophysiological mechanism behind this phenomenon.},

abstract = {Abstract Luther's Christology has long been suspected of deviating from the Chalcedonian Definition. Analysis of the suspicions raises in turn questions about Chalcedon as an incoherent compromise between the forces of Cyril and Leo. Complicating the issue is the metaphysical rendering of hypostasis as suppositum in medieval Western scholasticism. Luther's theopaschite Christology presses for the “repair” of Chalcedon by situating the Antiochene concern for Christ's human obedience within the divine self-donation of the Eternal Son according to the Alexandrians. In a Trinitarian Christology incorporating the Antiochene concern for the human obedience of Christ, there would be no competition between the personal union of the divine Son in taking on human body and soul and the Holy Spirit anointing this assumed flesh to create of it the new Adam.},
